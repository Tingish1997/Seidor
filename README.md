## Issues
Validation: React hook couldn't work out with current the current structure, but Yup is functional. 

Testing: Switch case should with redux from react testing library. However even as it's installed it's not able to work in the App.

Localization: The switch language is not working due to i18next index issue.

Solution: With current skill couldn't solve the issue, however it could work out with new structure with new build App.
